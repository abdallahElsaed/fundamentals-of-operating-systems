### Can the app work without OS?
- yes, you can make it but in this case you should build every thing from scratch, you should build service to deal with RAM, CPU, all IO device. this is big deal and make you code more complex.
- this way is so faster from dealing direct with OS because the OS is generic to cover every case for all applications in our computer.
